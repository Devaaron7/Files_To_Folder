# Files_To_Folder
Script that sends the files you drop into a folder you name

Quick script that will send file(s) into a folder you name when the script is run.
The folder will be the same directory as the files you selected.
The is meant to mimic the Mac "New Folder with Selection" option for Windows.

Usage

1. Drag & Drop the files you want to be moved onto the python file.


2. Type a name for the folder & hit "Ok".

Tip - You can place the python script in your "SendTo" folder, to make it quicker to send files into a folder.

Once you place the file there, you can right click -> send to - > "script" to send the files.
